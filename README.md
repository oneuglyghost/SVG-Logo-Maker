# SVG-Logo-Maker

the point of this project is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file Links to an external site.. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file. This will help with getting practice using node.js and have some experience using a command-line application.
